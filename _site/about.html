<p>Hi I am Fan Zhang, which is the name given my parents. I set several alarms to wake me up in the morning, and I usually get off the bed at the third clock. I had big dreams like everybody else does, but I find out I can live perfectly fine without those dreams. What wakes me up is the clock, not my dream. That is for sure.</p>

<p>I does not have too many opnions about the world. After all coming to this world is not my choice, but the consequence of the intercourse of my parents. However, the ambiguity of the life after death buffles me, so I would rather live in this world, as long as I can survive. If you ask me any question, I do not have much answer to offer, since I am as confused as you. The only thing I know is that I am 19, and I am neither happy nor sad.</p>
