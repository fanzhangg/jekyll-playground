<p>Morality is about determining whether an action is wrong or right. Morality is tightly related to our decision-making process and the retributive justice. Our moral beliefs guide our choice of actions. Our moral choices also influence our judgments toward our people’s behaviors. A person should be punished for a wrong action and rewarded for a right behavior.</p>

<p>Some philosophers cling to the theory of relativism to solve the problem of morality. They stated whether an action is right or wrong is relative to a special standpoint like culture. However, this view raises the problem of moral infallibility. We do an action because we believe it is right, and this belief that the action is right makes the action right. Thus, every action cannot even be wrong. On the contrary, Kant asserted whether an action is right and wrong is ruled by the objective and universal moral principles. Known as Categorical Imperative, his theory emphasized on our duty to obey the moral principle in all situations. To examine an action is to see whether the will of the action follows a moral principle. In this article, I try to illustrate the main arguments of the Kant’s Categorical Imperative, support the key assumptions in his theory and defend several weaknesses revealed by his theory.</p>

<p>For Kant, the criteria of whether an action is right or wrong is the goodwill of the action. A goodwill is an intention to follows a moral principle. Kant considered a goodwill as the only thing that is good without qualification: It is good to intend to do the moral things in all situations; The goodwill is good for itself rather than the consequence the goodwill leads. In this view, the consequence of an action is irrelevant to the right and wrong of the action. It is immoral if we use immoral approaches to achieve a good result, like torturing the prisoner to know the location of a hostage. On the other hand, it is moral if we want to do the moral action but the consequence becomes undesirable.</p>

<p>Kant believed we have the duty to follow the moral laws due to our free and rational nature. To begin with, Kant assumed we have the freedom to choose. In addition, he argued our free will is possible only if we can reason. Otherwise, we are merely guided by our desire and lose the control over our actions. With reason, we can know the right thing by examining whether the principle is consistent with the moral principle. With the free will, we can do the right thing by acting based on the moral principle. For instance, a male may feel sexual arousal when encountering an attractive female, but his reason warns him it is immoral to rape a woman without consent, so he is able to suppress his desire and do otherwise.</p>

<p>Kant assumed that the moral principle is universal. That means a moral principle should be obeyed by everyone in every situation. Based on this notion, he proposed the first formulation to unveil the moral principle. He suggested that we should act on those principles that you are willing them to be the universal laws without contradiction. To universalize a principle, we should imagine what will happen if everyone acts on the principle. If you think a principle is moral, you should be willing to live in a world where everyone acts on the principle. You are willing to do the thing to other people and let other people do the same thing to you. To avoid the contradiction, we need to examine if the moral principle can help us achieve the goal we initially want to achieve after universalizing it. Universalizing an immoral principle, however, will raise a logical contradiction. For instance, if a person steals a wallet, he acts on the principle of stealing and expects the end to gain property. Nevertheless, if he imagines a world where everyone can steal other’s things, the property he owns can be equally stolen by other people. Since living in a world of thieves cannot help him to achieve his goal to increase his property, the principle is not moral.</p>

<p>While Kant’s first formulation affirmed the universalizability of the moral principles, his second formulation underscored respecting people with dignity. Kant thought people are intrinsically valuable because of our free and rational nature. Therefore, we cannot treat others merely as means to an end. In other words, we cannot force others to do what we want to do in order to achieve our own goal. Instead, we need to realize that every individual as a rational being has its unique goal, and we should allow them to choose freely to seek their goal. In this sense, enslaving other people for our own benefits is immoral. Noticeably, it is common for treating other people to get a certain service. For example, I attend the lecture of Folina in order to learn philosophy. This action does not violate the second formulation since I do not merely the other person as a mean. Such an action can achieve both my and the other person’s goal, and the other one agrees on acting in this way. I want Folina to teach me to gain knowledge, and Folina is willing to teach me in order to fulfill her own goal of gaining salary or sharing her knowledge.</p>

<p>One of the basic assumptions of Kant’s moral theory is that the moral principles are universal. As laws of physics govern the motions of an object, we can deduce there are laws governing the right and wrong of an action. The laws of physics are consistent in any place and for any object. Similarly, the moral laws should treat any situation and any person equally. In addition, if we assume the moral laws vary among different situations and people, it becomes a poor guidance to help us decide whether an action is right or wrong. Therefore, assuming that the moral law is universal is reasonable and plausible.</p>

<p>One objection to Kant’s theory is its failure to provide a desirable solution when the ends of two groups of people conflict with each other. There are situations where respecting the end of one group requires treating another group merely as means. For example, if we isolate a person who got a Typhoid, we do so merely for avoiding to be infected. On the other hand, if we do not isolate the patient, we risk other people’s health to respect the freedom and comfort of the patient. According to the second formulation, both actions are immoral and not permissible. However, we can justify the isolation of the patient if considering the action as a form of punishment. If the carrier of the Typhoid does not volunteer to be isolated, he treats others merely as the mean to an end. When performing the action, he universalizes the principle that it is okay to treat others merely as a means to an end. Therefore, other people can act on the same principle and treat the patient merely as a means. It is fair to punish an action based on an immoral principle.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Kant emphasized on our duty to act morally but seems to neglect our desire for happiness. Though Kant did not put the happiness at the top place, a moral life does not exclude happiness. We can maintain personal happiness by performing our moral duty. For one thing, we can get joy when being rewarded for doing the moral things and avoid the suffering caused by the punishment for immoral actions. For another thing, since we have the duty to develop our talent, the praise of others and the sense of self-accomplishment after we have mastered a skill can certainly lead to happiness. In a larger scale, most of the misery is brought by people’s immoral actions. Though sometimes we get pleasure by doing an immoral action, this pleasure is always based on the great suffering of other people harmed by the action. Hence, acting immorally undermines the overall pleasure of human beings, and we can achieve a greater amount of total happiness by performing our moral duty. In short, obeying moral duty is an approach to accomplish the personal happiness and the total happiness of humanity.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Kant provides a framework to answer why we should and how to do the right thing: We ought to do the right thing because we are free and rational beings; We do the right thing when our will attempts to follow a moral principle. Moreover, Kant suggested two formulations to find out those moral principles. Kant’s attitude to treat morality as a duty inspires many modern moral theories as Ross’s Prima Facie Duties and Rawls’ Contractarianism.</p>
